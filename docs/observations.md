# Observations

IBM-style noise models show faster entanglement decay due to higher two-qubit gate errors.
IonQ-style backends preserve entanglement at higher depths, consistent with experimental reports.

Energy estimation error increases approximately linearly with noise strength.
Hardware-aware transpilation significantly reduces error accumulation.
