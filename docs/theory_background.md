# Theory Background

Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are hybrid quantum–classical algorithms designed for execution on NISQ hardware.
They rely on parametrized quantum circuits optimized using classical routines.

Entanglement plays a central role in the expressive power of VQAs, while hardware noise limits circuit depth and fidelity.
This work focuses on quantifying entanglement decay and energy estimation error under realistic hardware noise.
