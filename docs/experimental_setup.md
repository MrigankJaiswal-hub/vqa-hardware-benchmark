# Experimental Setup

Simulations were performed using Qiskit Aer with both ideal and noisy backends.
IBM-like superconducting hardware was modeled using CZ-based depolarizing noise.
IonQ-like trapped-ion hardware was modeled using XX-gate noise with reduced error rates.

Metrics evaluated include:
- Energy expectation values
- Circuit depth
- Concurrence-based entanglement
- Noise sensitivity
